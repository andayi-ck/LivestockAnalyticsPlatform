    steve Jobs said stay hungry , stay foolish
i know you were welcomed , but allow me to welcome you as well.In other circles , we call you chairman,but they
    they don't know what those circles are,,so welcome chairman
Yvonne's take -- sometimes it is important to surround yourself with people who are smarter than you, and being smarter may not mean that they
        are more educated than you, it could also mean that they know things in areas that you don't.Surely , one cannot understand bilogy, physics, aeronautics,
        medicine all at once.Some of the greatest leaders are the one that sit quietly in a room, listening to everyone speak, even the meek.Those who offer
        different perspectives to areas where one may have blindspots; and yes,we all have blindspots, regardless of our level of education...
    You might be the smartest one in the room, but not the most experienced.
    ---what if a doctor would say that he/she has reached the epitome of his/her study.That he/she doesnt need to learn anymore

    --I READ IT FROM A DIFFERENT RESEARCH PAPER THAT,
    ALBERT EINSTEIN - DEATH begins the day you stop seeking knowledge. -this doesnt mean physical death but death of the mind
    

    jamilla's Memo..
    But loving you country also means being able to disagree and correct where
    necessary.Patriotism is not blind loyalty.It includes tough love; Speaking out when things are not going in the right
    direction instead of applauding without question.This brings me to what some leaders have had to say about the locals reactions
    ...Some Kenyans were upset over the loss , while others elated,saying that they were happy with the outcome.The latter group became the target of heated
    criticism, both within parliament and outside.Thir celebration was labelled unpatriotic, shameful ,with warnings
    against such behavoiur.Some leaders even used words like 'primitive' and 'village mentality' to describe them.But
    lets be clear,people should allowed to feel however they want without being gagged
